In order to keep up with participation in the club you should subscribe to the
following newsletters. While they are not all mandatory (one will suffice), they
are all extremely helpful in the realm of finance and current economic news.
[Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/) is a electronic newsletter that
contains a plethora of information about a wide scope of domestic economic news.
[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) is a site you can create and account
and subscribe to their newsletter. This also contains a wide variety of economic
news, but tends to get more in depth as to catch things that morning brew may
miss.
[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/19/japan-inflation-edges-higher-but-bank-of-japan-still-in-a-bind.html)
is a site that offers economic news on both domestic and foreign fronts, it generally
offers videos to recap some of the economic information so it is better for people
who want a person to speak to them or visual representations of the information.
[WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/) is another newsletter that can be sent in physical
or electronic form. It is a subscription based newsletter and does cost money,
so it is not required by any means. However, it is very useful and provides
more in-depth stories on economic fronts than some of the other options. It
currently has both a student discount and a promotion of $1 for 2 months.
[ThinkorSwim](https://www.thinkorswim.com/t/index.html#!/innovation) is a program
that allows anyone to perform technical analysis on securities in the open market.
It is a slightly more advanced tool, but there are intuitive guides on how to
use it and what to look for in the graphs.
