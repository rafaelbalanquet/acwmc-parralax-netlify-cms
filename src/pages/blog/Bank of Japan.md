Japan's core inflation picked up slightly in March from a year earlier, but remained distant from the Bank of Japan's ambitious 2% target in a sign of rising pressure.

Over the past year, policymakers have had to contend with a slowdown in global demand as the Sino-U.S tariff war put a dent on world trade and hit Japanese exporters. This has made the Bank of Japan's task of generating inflation even more difficult.

Data on Friday showed a 0.8% increase in the nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products, but excludes volatile fresh food costs, compared with a median market forecast of 0.7%. In February, annual core consumer inflation hit 0.7%.

## The Bank of Japan

An index the Bank of Japan focuses on - the so-called core-core CPI that strips away the effect of both volatile food and energy costs - rose 0.4% in March, matching the annual increase in February.

The Central bank is in a bind. Years of heavy money printing have dried up bon market liquidity and hurt commercial bank profits, stoking concerns that its massive quantitative easing program is not sustainable.

Subdued inflation has left the BOJ well behind its counterparts in dialing back stimulus, including the United States where monetary policy had a bigger impact. Some economists also argue the BOJ has little ammunition left to fight another serious economic downturn.
