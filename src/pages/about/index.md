### Our Mission Statement
The Allegheny College Wealth Management Club (ACWMC) strives to give students a collaborative
environment in which they can openly discuss and learn about topics relating specifically to
personal finance. We utilize speakers, simulations, and individual research in order to
educate our members on personal finance and how they can get a head start on managing their
own money.

### Requirements
ACWMC is a no knowledge, no experience friendly group. Over the course of the first couple of weeks,
we instruct students to our data page, which holds different examples for analysis our members will
be undertaking. Our club is open to all current Allegheny College students,
just come to our weekly meetings ready to learn and have a seminar-style discussion
about the prior week of economic news!

### Our Mechanism
Our current framework consists of, but is not limited to, a mock stock market game,
fundamental and technic analysis of earnings calls and specific company's, discussions
about current economic policy and situations that may effect our markets, as well
as an "adopt a company" project. These help to get us motivated and geared toward the
mind set of daily economic thinking.

### Adopt a Company
One of the things we plan to implement and pursue in the future club is an "adopt a company"
project, where every member will pick a company in whichever industry they would like and
consistently provide up-to-date analysis of their company, such as news, public offerings, stock
price changes, different business deals, etc. This will also include the key information on
their most recent

### Reinvestment
While the club still is in an infant stage, we would like to insure that it continues to bring in
students who are interested in learning about these topics in a rather relaxed environment. For
this reason, we would like to have past executives and members alike to invest time into helping
later generations of students through both alumni relationships with future employers, along
with assistance in the actual club atmosphere itself. This will help develop topics and
standards the club should abide by in order to get our aspiring financially conscious students
a path in the right direction.
