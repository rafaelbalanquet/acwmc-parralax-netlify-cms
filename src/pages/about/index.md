### Our Mission Statement
The Allegheny College Wealth Management Club (ACWMC) strives to give students a collaborative
environment in which they can openly discuss and learn about topics relating specifically to
personal finance. We utilize speakers, simulations, and individual research in order to
educate our members on personal finance and how they can get a head start on managing their
own money.

### Requirements
ACWMC is a no knowledge, no experience friendly group. Over the course of the first couple of weeks,
we instruct students to our data page, which holds different examples for analysis our members will
be undertaking. Our club is open to all current Allegheny College students,
just come to our weekly meetings ready to learn and have a seminar-style discussion
about the prior week of economic news!

### Our Mechanism
Our current framework consists of, but is not limited to, a mock stock market game,
fundamental and technic analysis of earnings calls and specific company's, discussions
about current economic policy and situations that may effect our markets, as well
as an "adopt a company" project. These help to get us motivated and geared toward the
mind set of daily economic thinking.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
