heading: Building a Financially Conscientious Allegheny Community
description: >-
  The Allegheny College Wealth Management club is currently made up of a
  hardworking group of diverse majors with one common goal; to expand and disperse
  our knowledge of the ins and outs of finance. We want to be establish a
  framework and base for Econ students, and we are always eager to learn more.
  Collaborative learning is a huge part in building our knowledge, and we’re
  glad to pass that knowledge to anyone.

        We offer a weekly meeting that will cover various topics from earnings
        calls to guides for technical analysis. We want everyone to get
        as much out of the club as we are, so we offer a seminar style meeting
        where anyone who wants to offer some news, statistics, analysis, etc.
        is free to do as they please. One of the biggest talking points for the
        club is our stock market game with seminar evaluation.

        The stock market game takes place on Investopedia.com. Every semester
        we would like to start one towards the beginning and have it run for that
        18 or so week period. The goal of the game is to get people thinking
        about how the stock market and some other securities move in secondary
        markets. We want to monetize the competition, giving students a
        more rewarding incentive for keeping up to date with their stocks
        and with the market itself.

        Another big part of the club will be the employment of our adopt a
        market assignment. However, don't let the word assignment trick you,
        it's not graded (ha ha). We just want to get members engrained into
        thinking about how different companies in a market work, and how
        news and information from one effects them and the competition as well.
        This is a great way to understand how media shifts domestic and global
        markets.

        Allegheny has lacked a strong economic department presence. We want to
        be the pioneers that bring economics to the forefront. We, along with
        some of the ground level fundamental building we've proposed, want to
        also let students build external connections through speakers. We
        want to relate our work to the real world as much as possible because
        that relationship is what proves how important this information is.
        We want to facilitate connections to the executives of the business
        world, hopefully making those employment and internship searches a
        little bit easier.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

pricing:
  heading: What are you giving up?
  description: >-
    Absolutely nothing. The only cost you incur is the opportunity cost of
    doing something else with that maximum one hour meeting time once a week.
    We think it's a small price to pay for the plethora of knowledge at our
    disposal.
