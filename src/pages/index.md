  The Allegheny College Wealth Management club is currently made up of a hardworking
  group of people with divers majors and one common goal; to expand and disperse
  our knowledge of the ins and outs of finance. We want to establish a framework
  for Econ students, and we are always eager to learn more. Collaborative learning
  is a staple for building our understanding, and we are glad to pass that
  knowledge on to anyone willing to move us forward.

  title: Why ACWMC
  description: >
      We're dedicated. We are supported through the economics department. We
      strive to put students first. Starting your investments early exponentially
      increases returns. What more convincing do you need?

        We offer a weekly meeting that will cover various topics from earnings
        calls to guides for technical analysis. We want everyone to get
        as much out of the club as we are, so we offer a seminar style meeting
        where anyone who wants to offer some news, statistics, analysis, etc.
        is free to do as they please. One of the biggest talking points for the
        club is our stock market game with seminar evaluation.

        The stock market game takes place on Investopedia.com. Every semester
        we would like to start one towards the beginning and have it run for that
        18 or so week period. The goal of the game is to get people thinking
        about hwo the stock market and some other securities move in secondary
        markets. We want to monetize the competition, giving students a more
        rewarding incentive for keeping up to date with their stocks and
        with the market itself.

        Another big part of the club will the employment of our adopt a
        market assignment. However, don't let the word assignment trick you,
        it's not graded (ha ha). We just want to get members engrained into
        thinking about how different companies in a market work, and how
        news and information from one effects the company and the competition
        as well. This is a great way to understand how media shifts domestic
        and global markets.

        Allegheny has lacked a strong economic department presence. We want to
        be the pioneers that bring economics to the forefront. We, along with
        some of the ground level fundamental building we've proposed, want to
        also let students external connections through speakers. We
        want to relate our work to the real world as much as possible because
        that relationship is what proves how important this information is.
        We want to facilitate connections to the executives of the business world,
        hopefully making those employment and internship searches a little bit
        easier.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great community with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our members to the highest standards when it comes to engaging with
    the material and effectively learning to propel the group in a positive
    direction. As we move through the development, Allegheny College has elected
    to possibly set aside parts of the economic department endowment in order to
    give us the ability to manage real funds.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
